## Quadratic Equation
  The quadratic equation is one of the most well known, and hated, of formulas to come from algebra. In short, the equation is used to solve for the independent variable of a 2nd order real valued polynomial equation, or
  \begin{equation}
  ax^{2} + bx + c = 0
  \end{equation}
  Rather than factoring the polynomial, there exists a closed form equation that will give the values of x:
  \begin{equation}
  x = -b \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}
  \end{equation}
One reaches the quadratic equations as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
ax^{2} + bx + c & = 0 \\
4a^{2}x^{2} + 4abx + 4ac & = 0 \\
4a^{2}x^{2} + 4abx & = 4ac \\
(2ax + b)^{2} &= b^{2} - 4ac \\
2ax + b &= \pm\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac} \\
2ax &= -b \pm\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac} \\
x &= \frac{b\pm\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
